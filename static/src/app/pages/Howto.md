## How to play?

This game is suitable for 6 - 13 players. Many versions of this game exists but a suggested version is as described below.

### Goal of the game
The goal of the game is to find out which player is blank. At the start of the game, players are secretly assigned an identity, **[Object 1]**, **[Object 2]**, or **blank**. 

Non-blank players win by finding out who blank is.

Blank player(s) win by not being uncovered after 3 - 5 rounds.

### Assignment phase
At the assigning phase, the game master type in two objects and the number of players into the form on the [homepage](/).

Then the game master pass the screen to the left/right. Players got assigned identities by tapping on the coloured section. Tap on next player after reading it. Then pass the screen on to the next player and so on.

After every player being assigned an identity, pass the screen back to the game master. The game master can now secretly tap on the coloured section to see the identity distribution.

### Bluff phase
There can be 3 - 5 rounds during the bluff phase. Game master can decide how many rounds there are.

During each round, players take turns to describe his/her identity. Blanks would have to bluff and try to hide amongst the other players. 

> Example: Peter's identity is apple. So he says "I am red". Then it is Mary's turn. Mary's identity is blank, and since she heard the clues from before, she figures one of the objects is apple. Therefore she says "I am round".

After each round, players can discuss and vote to kick out one player who they think is blank. The player must reveal his identity if and only if he/she is the most voted player and he/she has more than half of the votes.

### Winning
If after 3 - 5 rounds some blanks are still remain in cover, then the blanks win. If there are no more blanks, each blank would have a chance to guess one of the objects. If he/she successfully guessed the object, blank wins. Otherwise, other players win.
